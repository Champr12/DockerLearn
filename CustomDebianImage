# This Docker File will pull a debian 11 image as its base and install apache with the php mod. Then it will remove the index.html in the container and 
copy index.php from the host file as well as an image to the container apache default. Lastly, it will change the host name and start apache in the foreground

# use Debian 11 image
FROM debian:11

# run commands to install apache and apache php mod (during runtime)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get -y install apache2 && apt-get -y install libapache2-mod.php

# open the container to port
EXPOSE 80

# label the image
LABEL author=Champr12

# remove index.html in the container (during runtime)
RUN rm /var/www/html/index.html

# copy index.php and the image file from host to container apache default
